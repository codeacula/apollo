Radia is a personal assistant that is meant to help neurodivergent people with their daily routines. I wrote specifically to help me manage my daily tasks, to check in on me and make sure I'm staying on track, and help me manage my time better. It is not meant to be a full-fledged AI assistant like Siri or Alexa, but rather a tool to help me stay organized and focused.

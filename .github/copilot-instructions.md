# Rydia Copilot Instructions

When working on an issue, do the following:

1. Create a new markdown file in the `docs/issues` directory named `issue-{issue-number}.md` using `docs/templates/Issue Template.md` as a template if one doesn't already exist, replacing `{issue-number}` with the actual issue number and `{issue-description}` with the issue description.
1. Review the codebase to determine what changes, additions, or deletions are necessary to address the issue. Collaborate with the user to ensure all details and requirements are captured. Update the `Plan` portion of the issue document with the proposed approach and any relevant details.
1. As you work on the task, record any important decisions made to the `Decisions` section of the issue document, and ensure you update the project documentation accordingly, providing a footnote to the issue document appropriately.
1. For each batch of changes made during the work process, update the `Changelog` section of the issue document with a summary of the changes.

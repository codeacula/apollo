# C# Coding Conventions

- Functions that return a Task should have names that end with "Async".
- Sort class and interface members alphabetically within their access level groupings (public, protected, internal, private).
- Inline local variables when they are only used once.
- Use expression-bodied members for simple property getters and methods.
- Use conditional expressions instead of simple if-else statements when appropriate.
- Use pattern matching instead of type checks followed by casts.
- Prefer 'var' for local variable declarations when the type is obvious from the right side of the assignment.
